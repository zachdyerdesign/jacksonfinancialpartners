### My Mission

For over 30 years, my life’s mission has been to serve and protect my family and those in and out of my community. I have been accountable for the protection and conservation of many people’s lives, property and assets; raised my children to adulthood; weathered financial storms; been the caretaker of immediate family members and have dealt with death and near death experiences. I love spending time with my family in the outdoors whether we are canoeing, camping, fishing, hunting or gardening.

I also Support Autism Awareness, Veterans’ Needs and Homeless Projects through Acts Media Group in Missouri. I Volunteer my time with other Non-Profit Organizations as well as helping out with various youth programs to teach children about character, ethics, principals and how to be financially responsible.

I understand the struggle of everyday life, the fight and the will to survive; as well as the everyday financial stress or impact that most people feel ; and I know about the “What If’s”, the “When Will’s, or the “How Come’s”.
“I’ve Lived It, I Live it and I will help you live through it.”

Whether you are planning for your business or your family, my team will take the time to listen to your needs, evaluate your circumstances, create a sound strategy and implement a plan to help you reach your goals and objectives in order to avoid financial pitfalls while providing peace of mind so that you may rest easy and enjoy life.
